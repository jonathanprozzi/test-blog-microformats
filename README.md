# Microformats Boilerplate HTML

## Purpose

The purpose of the _index.html_ and _post.html_ files is to create a straight-forward HTML boilerplate for both a main page (index.html) and sample single post (post.html).

This is based on my [Microformats Boilerplate HTML](https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/microformats-boilerplate) repo where I hope to create an HTML template for use as a boilerplate with proper Microformats markup.

This repo has actual site data that can be used to test things such as IndieLogin and other headers.

Publishing this on Netlify so that I have a live site to test Microformats and auths.
